make for containers

some tooling around running containers with different configurations
something extensible of docker-compose, but easier to use CLI tool

- automatically add dockbeat to container images for metrics and logging
- make it easy to test container behavior w/ arbitrary i/o
- make it easy to test distributed systems of containers
